# Task 04 ‚Äì Global Road Accidents Analysis üö¶

## Objective
The goal of this task was to analyze road accidents data and identify key patterns related to **time of day, road conditions, and accident severity**.  
This analysis was done using **Power BI** to build an interactive dashboard.

## Dashboard Pages & Visuals
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Time Analysis  
- Accidents by Day of Week  
- Accidents by Hour  
- Accidents by Month  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Road & Lighting Conditions  
- Accidents by Lighting Condition  
- Accidents by Roadway Surface  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Severity Analysis  
- Fatal vs Total Injuries

## Key Observations
- Certain **hours of the day** have higher accident counts (peak traffic times).  
- **Lighting conditions** such as ‚ÄúDark ‚Äì no streetlights‚Äù show higher fatality rates.  
- **Roadway defects and surface conditions** contribute significantly to accidents.  
- **Weekend days** often record more severe crashes compared to weekdays.
